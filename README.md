# RCIC: Resource-Constrained Image Classification

## Overview

Project files for our framework evaluating machine learning models on resource-constrained devices. Our use-case focuses on image classification fine-tuning various pre-trained models on the Caltech-101 dataset. The framework assesses model performance on low-end hardware with varying CPU and RAM configurations.

## Files and Folders

* `scripts/`
  * `train_model.py`: Trains models, saves to `models/`, generates `data/test/test_ds.pkl`, and downloads Caltech-101 dataset to `data/caltech101/`
  * `prepare_test_images.py`: Converts test dataset to JPG images in `data/test/test_images`
  * `model_prediction.py`: Evaluates model performance on low-end hardware
  * `plots.py`: Generates plots comparing model performance metrics
* `models/`: Trained models (initially empty placeholder files)
* `data/`
  * `test/`: Test dataset and test images
    * `test_ds.pkl`: Test dataset (initially empty placeholder file)
    * `test_images/`: 101 JPG test images
  * `caltech101`: Caltech-101 dataset files and subfolders (generated after running `train_model.py`)
* `results/`: Plots comparing model performance metrics generated by `plots.py` script

## Usage

* Run `train_model.py` on powerful hardware to train models and generate a test dataset.
* Run `prepare_test_images.py` to convert the test dataset to JPG images.
* Run `model_prediction.py` on low-end hardware to evaluate model performance.
